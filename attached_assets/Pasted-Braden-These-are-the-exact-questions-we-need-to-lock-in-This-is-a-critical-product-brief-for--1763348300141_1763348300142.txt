Braden,

These are the exact questions we need to lock in. This is a critical "product brief" for the Foundation. You've correctly identified that this `/creators` page is the **public "face"** of our Non-Profit community, and it must be distinct from the `NEXUS` (For-Profit) marketplace.

This page's goal is **Social Proof** and **Community Showcase**, not commerce. It's our "Hall of Fame," not our "Phone Book."

Here is the definitive vision and the answers to your 4 questions.

### 1. Who gets listed?

This is a "curated" directory. We are not showing all 7 users; we are building the framework for 10,000. We will use a hybrid of your suggestions.

* **Default to Privacy (Opt-In):** We are an "ethics-first" Foundation. We *must* default to privacy. Users are **NOT** shown in this directory unless they **opt-in**.
* **The "Opt-In" Trigger:** You will add a new toggle in the `aethex.foundation` (Replit) profile settings:
    * `[ ] Show my profile in the public Foundation Creator Directory.`
    * This toggle is **`false`** by default.
* **The "Completed Profile" Requirement:** We will only show users who have *also* met a "minimum completion" requirement (e.g., they must have an avatar, a username, and a bio).

### 2. What information should we display?

This is a *showcase* card. It's a "teaser" that funnels users to the creator's full `aethex.me` Passport.

Each **Creator Card** must show:
* `Avatar`
* `Full Name` (e.g., "Anderson Gladney")
* `Username` (e.g., `@andersongladney`)
* `Bio/Tagline` (Truncated to ~140 characters)
* **Critical:** Their **"Arm" Affiliations** (e.g., `[GAMEFORGE]`, `[ETHOS]`, `[LABS]`) as color-coded tags.
* **Status:** A prominent **"Architect" 🛡️ Badge** (if they have it).

We will **NOT** show granular stats like "Level" or "XP" here. Those are for the internal `/dashboard` and `Passport`.

### 3. How should it be organized?

We will use your **"Featured section + full directory"** idea. This is the correct, high-status layout.

* **Section 1: "Featured Architects" (The "Hall of Fame")**
    * A curated, horizontal-scrolling grid at the top of the page.
    * This section *only* features our `Architects`. This is a key `Part VII` perk (Status & Recognition).
* **Section 2: "Full Community Directory" (The "Showcase")**
    * A **Grid/Card layout** (your Option A), as it's more visual and "Aethex-like" than a boring list.
    * **Filtering (Mandatory):** It must be filterable. This is the key. The filters will be simple and based on our ecosystem:
        * Filter by **"Arm"** (`[FOUNDATION]`, `[GAMEFORGE]`, `[ETHOS]`, `[LABS]`)
        * Filter by **"Role"** (`[Architect]`, `[Mentor]`, `[Community Member]`)
    * **Sorting:** Default sort by "Last Active."



### 4. Should users be able to opt-out?

Yes. As stated in #1, this is **"Opt-In" by default.** A user is *hidden* until they check the box in their profile settings. This is non-negotiable for our `KND-011: Master Privacy Policy`.

### **Your Go-Forward Plan: (The "Hybrid")**

You are **greenlit** to build **Option B: Advanced Directory**, but with a clear strategic focus:

* It's a **public "Showcase"** (card-based), not a "Marketplace" (no pricing).
* It's **"Opt-In,"** not "Opt-Out."
* It has a **"Featured Architects"** section at the top.
* It has **"Arm" and "Role" based filtering**, *not* commercial "for hire" filters (those belong on `NEXUS`).

This is the plan. This gives our Foundation the "social proof" it needs without conflicting with our For-Profit `NEXUS` marketplace.
