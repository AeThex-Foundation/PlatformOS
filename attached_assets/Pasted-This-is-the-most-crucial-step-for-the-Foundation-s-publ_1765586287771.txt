This is the most crucial step for the Foundation's public interface. The `aethex.foundation` website must serve two masters: be inspiring for donors and be bulletproof for regulators (IRS/SEC). 

You need a clear **Legal Disclaimer/Terms of Use** page separate from the Privacy Policy.

Here is the structure and required content for the **Legal Disclaimer** section specifically relating to the DAO and Token.

---

### **A. Required Legal Disclaimer Content (The SEC Firewall)**

This section must be prominent and use clear language to definitively separate the Governance Token from any financial security, protecting Anderson and the AeThex Inc. Corporation.

| Disclaimer Section | Required Statement | Strategic Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **NO INVESTMENT PURPOSE** | **"The AeThex Governance Token is NOT an investment, security, share, or financial instrument of any kind."**. | Directly counters the SEC's Howey Test (Investment of Money). |
| **NO EXPECTATION OF PROFIT** | **"The Token carries NO expectation of future profit, dividend, yield, or monetary return from the activities or success of AeThex Inc. or AeThex Foundation."**. | Directly counters the "Expectation of Profit" element of the Howey Test. |
| **GOVERNANCE ONLY** | **"The Token is a functional utility token intended SOLELY for voting on the operational matters of the Foundation's mission (e.g., curriculum, grant allocation) and represents a measure of community contribution/reputation."**. | Defines utility as non-financial governance, which is a key legal distinction. |
| **TOKEN IS EARNED, NOT BOUGHT** | **"Tokens are earned only through verifiable labor, mentorship, and project contributions. The Foundation will not sell these Governance Tokens for cash or cryptocurrency."**. | Reinforces the earned, merit-based system, preventing the perception of a securities offering. |
| **LIMITED LIABILITY** | **"Participation in the DAO is subject to the risk of legal liability as an unincorporated association."** *OR* **"The Foundation's non-profit legal entity (AZ Non-Profit Corp) is intended to limit the personal liability of token holders in accordance with Arizona law."**. | Addresses the primary liability risk for DAO members (being treated as a general partnership).

### **B. General Website Legal Requirements**

In addition to the DAO-specific section, the site must include these core components:

1.  **Terms of Use / Service Agreement:**
    * **Permissible Use:** Sets the rules for using the website and the DAO platform.
    * **User-Generated Content (UGC):** A disclaimer that users are responsible for their own content (crucial for forum/Discord integration).
    * **Intellectual Property:** A clause stating that all content (code, art, music) is copyrighted by AeThex and cannot be reproduced without consent.
    * **Governing Law & Venue:** Explicitly state that disputes will be governed by the laws of **Arizona** (reinforcing the AZ nexus).
    * **Limitation of Liability:** A clause protecting the Foundation from errors or damages arising from website use.

2.  **Privacy Policy:**
    * **Data Collection:** Clearly detail *what* donor/user data is collected (e.g., email, donation amount) and *why*.
    * **Data Sharing:** State whether donor information is shared with AeThex Inc. (likely yes, for recruitment) and with whom else.
    * **Opt-Out:** Provide a clear mechanism for donors to opt-out of marketing communications and data sharing.

3.  **Copyright Notice:**
    * A simple footer: **Copyright © AeThex Foundation, [Current Year]**.

**Final Action:** These disclaimers must be clear and easily comprehensible to the average user, not buried in legal jargon. They should be linked prominently in the website's footer and on the DAO dashboard.
