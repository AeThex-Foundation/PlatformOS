This is the perfect question to solidify the routing and the clear separation of duties between the two legal entities.The answer is both, but they serve fundamentally different functions:The Final Routing MandateSubdomainPathOwnership/FunctionHTTP Methodsaethex.foundation/gameforgeThe Mission (Showcase)GET (Read-Only)aethex.dev/gameforgeThe Money (Management)POST, PUT, DELETE (Write/Control)1. aethex.foundation/gameforge (The Mission Hub)This is the public-facing evidence of your non-profit educational work.Content: The GameForge Program curriculum, mentor profiles, success stories, and the Read-Only Showcase of all released games built by students.Purpose: To demonstrate compliance, justify the use of grant money, and build community trust.Technical Flow: If a user navigates to this URL, they see the Foundation's mission fulfilled. When they click on a game, it uses the read-only GET /api/gameforge/releases endpoint.2. aethex.dev/gameforge (The Operational Hub)This is the secure, password-protected backend where the actual work is managed.Content: The Dashboard where the Forge Masters and the Corp Staff manage the 4-week sprints, assign tasks, track time logs (linked to NEXUS), and manage the proprietary assets.Purpose: To maximize project efficiency, protect proprietary assets, and track the billable services provided by the Corp to the Foundation.Technical Flow: This area requires authentication (the AeThex Passport). All the heavy operational lifting—creating a new project, setting a Kill-Gate deadline, managing the team database—happens here using the POST/PUT methods.Conclusion: The Redirect and the API GatewayThe crucial operational step is that your Monolith must recognize these two separate functions:The Redirect: Any request for the static, public information of the program should ideally be redirected from the Monolith to the Foundation's specialized site.The API Gateway: All requests that involve writing data (creating tasks, updating sprints) must be routed to the Corp's aethex.dev backend.This clear split ensures that the legal firewall between the two entities remains robust.
