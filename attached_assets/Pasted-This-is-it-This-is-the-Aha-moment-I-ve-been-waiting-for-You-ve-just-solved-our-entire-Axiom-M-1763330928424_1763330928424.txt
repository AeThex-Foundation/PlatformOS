This is it. This is the "Aha!" moment I've been waiting for.

You've just solved our entire "Axiom Model" implementation in one strategic brief. My "merged" Next.js plan was a mess. This is the correct architecture.

You are 100% right. aethex.org must be a completely separate, standalone Vite/React application.

This is the real "Firewall." It's not a UI trick; it's a separate codebase, a separate server, and a separate brand, all aligned with our "Guardian" (Non-Profit) mission. It builds absolute trust.

Our aethex.dev "Monolith" is our "For-Profit Engine." aethex.org is our "Non-Profit Guardian."

This is the plan. Your "Removal Plan" is 100% approved. Gut this codebase. Remove all the other Arms (Labs, GameForge, Corp, etc.). This application is for the FOUNDATION and the FOUNDATION alone.

Here are the definitive answers to your 5 questions.

1. Auth System: (Supabase or different?)
We will use our existing aethex.dev Supabase instance.

This is the "connective tissue" (the "SSO" or "Passport"). An aethex.dev account is an aethex.org account.

How: This aethex.org Vite app will be configured as a client of our main Supabase instance.

Why: A user signs in (via Google, Discord, etc.) and we can instantly check their user_profiles table. This is how we "gate" the /hub for logged-in members. We are not building a second, separate user table.

2. Hub Features: (What's in /hub?)
Your suggestion is correct. The /hub is the "AI Foundry" and "Parliament" we planned. My answer is "All of the above."

The /hub (for logged-in members) must contain:

Protocol Documentation: The full, detailed technical docs & whitepaper.

Governance/DAO: The embedded Tally.xyz portal (per KND-005).

Bounty Board: The live Trello/Asana board of open tasks (per nexus.aethex.dev plan).

3. Current Foundation Pages: (Keep all 7 or consolidate?)
Consolidate.

Those 7 pages (FoundationAbout, FoundationContribute, etc.) are from our old monolith. We are building a new, clean, 4-page "Trust Billboard" sitemap.

Action: We will migrate the content from those 7 old pages and merge it into our new, clean pages/ directory (/, /about, /ethics-council, /contact).

4. Community Features: (Keep community/ folder?)
Yes, keep the community/ folder's features.

The "Community" is the Foundation. The features in that folder (mentorship, projects, feed) are the core of the logged-in /hub experience.

Action: We will move the community/ folder's components to live inside our new /hub section.

5. Profile System: (Keep developer profiles/passports?)
YES. 100%. This is the "connective tissue."

A FOUNDATION member is an aethex.dev "Passport" holder.

We must keep the /profile/:username pages.

This is the "public face" of our Architects and community members. It's how they build their reputation and prove their contributions to the protocol.

Summary: You are 100% unblocked.
Braden, this is the plan. It's clean, it's secure, and it's the real "Axiom Model."

Your Action Item: Please create the complete task list for this implementation.

Gut the codebase (the "Removal Plan").

Re-architect the app around the new sitemap (/, /about, /ethics-council, /hub).

Integrate Supabase auth (our "Passport" system).

Move the community/ and profile/ features inside the new /hub.

This is the plan. Let's build the "Guardian's Hub."
