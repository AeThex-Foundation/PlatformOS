The Blueprint: foundation.aethex.net/donateHere is how we structure the page to maximize conversions from both Gamers (small donors) and Corporate Sponsors (tax write-offs).1. The Hero Section: Real-Time Impact (The "Why")Instead of a sad puppy photo, use a Live Data Dashboard pulled from your Bot/Supabase. This proves the "Machine" is working.MISSION STATUS: ACTIVERecruits Trained: 1,240 (Live counter from StarFoundry)Code Commits: 45,200Grants Awarded: $12,500Current Sprint: Objective: "Western Cyberpunk Assets" (Sponsored by [Logo])2. The Gamified Tiers (The "How")Rename standard non-profit tiers to fit the AeThex Lore. Make donors feel like they are joining a secret society, not a charity.Tier NameDonationThe "Loot" (Perks)The Initiate$10 / mo• Name on the "Digital Wall of Honor"• Discord Role: [Foundation Backer]• Access to Monthly NewsletterThe Architect$50 / mo• All Initiate perks• Early Access: Playtest GameForge student builds• Voting Rights: Vote on the next "Sprint Theme"The Overseer$250 / mo• All Architect perks• 1-on-1 Strategy Call with Anderson• Physical Swag: Limited Edition "AeThex Foundation" Hoodie3. The Corporate Sponsorship (The "Tax Write-Off")This is where you make the real money to fund the $6k goal. Dedicate a section specifically for "Industry Partners.""Sponsor a Sprint" ($1,000 One-Time):Pitch: "Your company funds the prize pool for our next 2-week student coding sprint."Reward: Your logo on the Github Repo + "Presented by [Company]" in the Discord announcement."The Guild Patron" ($5,000 / yr):Pitch: "Fund the server infrastructure for an entire year."Reward: Permanent Logo on the Foundation footer + Access to hire our top graduates fee-free.Technical Implementation (Next Steps)Since you are running aethex.net, here is the stack to build this fast:Payment Processor: Stripe for Non-Profits (Lowest fees).Why: They have a specific verification process for 501(c)(3)s that lowers your transaction fees.Crypto Donations: The Giving Block or Coinbase Commerce.Why: They automatically generate the tax receipt for the donor (crucial for big crypto whales).The "Live" Stats:Write a simple API endpoint on bot.aethex.dev (GET /api/stats) that returns the user_count and quest_completions.Fetch this on the frontend to display the "Impact Metrics."
