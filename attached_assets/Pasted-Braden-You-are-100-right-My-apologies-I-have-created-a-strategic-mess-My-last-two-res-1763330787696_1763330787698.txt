Braden,

You are **100% right.** My apologies. I have created a strategic mess.

My last two responses, where I separated `nexus.aethex.dev` and `aethex.org`, were a **critical mistake** and a failure of vision. It created the very "Brand Fragmentation" (Risk \#4) we are trying to solve. You are right to be confused.

**This stops now.** Let's "merge them" and create the *single, correct* plan.

### The "Aha\!" Moment: The Final, Unified Foundation Plan

You are not building two sites. You are building **ONE** platform for the Foundation.

  * **The "Brochure" and the "App" are the SAME website.**
  * The simple, 4-page "Trust Billboard" (from the `aethex.org` plan) is the **public-facing "homepage"** of the *same* application that hosts the complex "AI Foundry" (the `nexus.aethex.dev` plan).

**The Final, Correct Domain Strategy:**

  * **`aethex.org` is the one and only domain for the Foundation.** It is our "Guardian's Hub."
  * **`nexus.aethex.dev` is DEPRECATED.** We will not use it. All of its features and plans are being **merged into `aethex.org`**.

This is the "best-of-both-worlds":

1.  A user (like a journalist or partner) lands on **`aethex.org`** and sees a simple, professional "Trust Billboard."
2.  A developer (our "Community") logs in (via our `aethex.dev` Passport) and gets access to the "logged-in" part of `aethex.org`, which is the "AI Foundry" (the Bounties, DAO, and Protocol docs).

**One platform. One domain. Two experiences (logged-out vs. logged-in).**

This is the plan. Here is the **new, definitive Replit structure** for **`aethex.org`** that "merges" both plans.

### **Replit File Structure: `aethex.org` (The "Unified Foundation")**

**Tech Stack:** **Next.js (App Router)** (per `KND-003`). *We are abandoning the simple Vite/React plan; it is not powerful enough.*

### **The "Merged" User Flow (How It Works):**

1.  **A "Public" User** (e.g., a journalist) visits **`aethex.org`**.

      * They see the simple, professional "Trust Billboard" pages (`/`, `/axiom-model`, `/ethics-council`).
      * They are *not* logged in. The "Header" they see is the `PublicHeader.tsx`.
      * The "Join" button in this header links them to **`aethex.dev/login`** to get a "Passport."

2.  **A "Community" User** (e.g., an AI Researcher) visits **`aethex.org`**.

      * They click the "Login" button (which goes to `aethex.dev/login`).
      * After logging in with their "Passport (SSO)," they are redirected *back* to **`aethex.org/hub`**.
      * Now, they see the **`HubHeader.tsx`** and **`HubSidebar.tsx`**, which lets them access the full "AI Foundry" (Protocol Docs, Governance, Bounties, etc.).

This is the final, unified plan. It gives us **one** Foundation site (`aethex.org`) that is both a simple "brochure" for the public and a powerful "app" for our community.
