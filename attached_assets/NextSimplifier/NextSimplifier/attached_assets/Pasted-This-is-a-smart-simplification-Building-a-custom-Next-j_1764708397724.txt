This is a smart simplification. Building a custom Next.js multi-tenant architecture on Vercel is powerful, but it is also complex. If you are already using **Replit** for your other sites (`aethex.foundation`), it makes perfect sense to consolidate the "Passport" system there too.

You are asking: **How do we execute the "Identity Strategy" (`.me` for people, `.space` for projects) using ONLY Replit?**

Here is the definitive, simplified plan using Replit's capabilities.

### **The Replit Identity Strategy**

We will build **ONE** Replit project that acts as the "Profile Engine." This single Replit app will handle traffic for both `aethex.me` and `aethex.space`.

### **1. The Architecture (Replit-Centric)**

Instead of complex middleware on Vercel, we use a simple **Express.js** server on Replit to route the traffic.

* **The Host:** A single Replit project (e.g., `@AeThex/Passport-Engine`).
* **The Domains:**
    * You point `*.aethex.me` (CNAME) -> `passport-engine.aethex.repl.co` (or your custom Replit domain).
    * You point `*.aethex.space` (CNAME) -> `passport-engine.aethex.repl.co`.
* **The Database:** It connects to your existing **Supabase** instance to fetch user and project data.



### **2. The Server Logic (The "Bouncer" on Replit)**

On Replit, you have full control over the server (unlike Vercel's serverless functions, which can be tricky). This makes the routing logic very straightforward.

**The Logic Flow:**
1.  A request hits your Replit server.
2.  The server checks the `host` header.
3.  **IF** the host ends in `.aethex.me`:
    * It extracts the subdomain (e.g., `andersongladney`).
    * It queries Supabase for that **User**.
    * It renders the **"Creator Profile"** template.
4.  **IF** the host ends in `.aethex.space`:
    * It extracts the subdomain (e.g., `chroma-shift`).
    * It queries Supabase for that **Project**.
    * It renders the **"Project Showcase"** template.
5.  **IF** the host is unknown (or the root domain), it redirects to `aethex.dev` (The Monolith).

### **3. The "Creator Profile" Template (`.me`)**

Since this is a dedicated "Profile Engine," we can make it lightweight and fast.

* **Visuals:** Uses the **"Night Mode"** (Dark/Neon) aesthetic by default.
* **Content:**
    * **Avatar & Name**
    * **"Verified" Checkmark** (if they have the `.aethex` TLD).
    * **Badges Grid** (Architect, GameForge, etc.).
    * **"Hire Me" Button** (Links to `NEXUS`).
* **Tech:** Simple React or even raw HTML/EJS templates for maximum speed.

### **4. The "Project Showcase" Template (`.space`)**

* **Visuals:** Uses the **"GameForge"** (Green/Pixel) aesthetic.
* **Content:**
    * **Game Title & Hero Image**
    * **Team Roster** (Links to their `.me` profiles).
    * **"Play Now" Button** (Links to `aethex.fun`).
    * **"Scope Anchor"** summary.

### **Why this is better for you right now:**

1.  **Centralized Control:** You can tweak the profile design in one Replit project without redeploying your massive `aethex.dev` monolith.
2.  **Speed:** Replit deployments are instant.
3.  **Simplicity:** You don't need to fight with Vercel's edge middleware or domain configuration limitations.

**Your Next Step:**
Create a new Replit project called **"AeThex-Passport-Engine"** and I can give you the `server.js` code to handle the routing.
