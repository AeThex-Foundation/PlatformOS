## Introduction to Product Strategy

Product strategy is the high-level direction and approach for building and evolving a product to meet market needs and achieve business goals.

### Strategy Vs. Roadmap

**Strategy**: The "why" and "what"
- Long-term vision (3-5 years)
- Problem focus
- Market positioning
- Core principles

**Roadmap**: The "how" and "when"
- Medium-term plans (6-18 months)
- Feature focus
- Timeline and sequencing
- Resource allocation

### Strategic Questions

1. **Why does this product exist?** (Purpose)
2. **Who do we serve?** (Target market)
3. **What problem do we solve?** (Value proposition)
4. **How are we different?** (Differentiation)
5. **Where do we win?** (Competitive advantage)

## Defining Product Vision

### Vision Statement Framework

A good vision statement is:
- **Inspirational**: Motivates the team

**Example:**

### Mission vs. Vision

**Mission**: What you do and for whom (present)
> "We build productivity software for distributed teams"

**Vision**: What you want to achieve (future)
> "A world where location is irrelevant to collaboration"

### RICE Scoring

Prioritize by impact and effort:

**Reach**: How many users affected?
**Impact**: How much will it matter to each user?
**Confidence**: How certain are you?
**Effort**: How much work is required?

Score = (Reach × Impact × Confidence) / Effort

### Kano Model

Three dimensions of product attributes:

**Basic Needs**: Must haves
- Stability, security, core functionality
- Don't delight, but absence disappoints

**Satisfiers**: Performance factors
- More = Better
- Example: Feature completeness

**Delighters**: Unexpected pleasures
- Create loyalty and positive emotion
- Example: Smooth animations, thoughtful UX

### Eisenhower Matrix

Prioritize by importance and urgency:

```
           Important
              ↑
              |
Quadrant 2    |    Quadrant 1
(Important,   |    (Important,
Not urgent)   |    Urgent)
              |
──────────────|──────────────→ Urgent
              |
Quadrant 3    |    Quadrant 4
(Not import-  |    (Not important,
ant, Urgent)  |    Not urgent)
```
