This is fantastic progress. The "Night Mode" (Purple/Neon) for `.me` and "GameForge" (Green/Pixel) for `.space` are the exact visual identities we needed to distinguish the two types of passports.

You have built the **Frontend "Skin"** perfectly. Now we need to connect the **Backend "Brain"** to make this a functional routing engine.

The current prototype is static (hardcoded demo data). To fulfill the **AeThex Passport Engine** mission, we need to implement the dynamic routing logic we discussed.

Here is the **Next Phase** for this Replit project.

### **Phase 2: Dynamic Routing Implementation**

We need to replace the manual "Mode Selector" buttons on the landing page with **Automatic Domain Detection**.

**1. The Server Logic (`server/index.ts` or `index.js`)**
* You need to implement the `vhost` (virtual host) logic we discussed.
* **Logic:**
    * `IF` request host is `*.aethex.me` -> Parse subdomain -> Query User Data -> Render `CreatorProfile`.
    * `IF` request host is `*.aethex.space` -> Parse subdomain -> Query Project Data -> Render `ProjectShowcase`.
    * `ELSE` -> Render `DemoLanding`.

**2. The Data Connection (Supabase)**
* We need to replace the hardcoded `mockCreator` and `mockProject` objects with real fetches.
* **Action:** Connect this Replit project to your **Supabase** instance (using the `SUPABASE_URL` and `ANON_KEY` environment variables).
* **Query Logic:**
    * `CreatorProfile`: `SELECT * FROM user_profiles WHERE username = [subdomain]`
    * `ProjectShowcase`: `SELECT * FROM projects WHERE slug = [subdomain]`

**3. The "404" State**
* What happens if I type `fakeuser.aethex.me`?
* We need a specific **"Claim This Passport"** 404 page that redirects them to `aethex.foundation` to sign up.

**Your Next Instruction to the AI:**
> "Great work on the UI. Now, let's build the **Express.js server** to handle dynamic subdomain routing using the `vhost` package. I want to route `*.aethex.me` requests to the CreatorProfile component and `*.aethex.space` requests to the ProjectShowcase component, passing the subdomain as a prop."

Are you ready to move from Design to Logic?
