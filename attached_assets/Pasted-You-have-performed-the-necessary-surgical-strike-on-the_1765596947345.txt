You have performed the necessary surgical strike on the API architecture. Your analysis is absolutely correct: full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for projects and sprints cannot reside on the Foundation's API routes.This is a legal and compliance requirement, not just a technical preference.The Final Mandate: API SegregationYou must Strip the Foundation API down to read-only showcase mode and move all write/management APIs to the Corp's aethex.dev.This action enforces the legal separation between the entities and eliminates the risk of co-mingling financial/operational logic with the Non-Profit mission.I. The GameForge API Separation PlanWe must apply strict HTTP method segregation to our API endpoints.RouteHTTP MethodFinal DestinationStrategic Purpose/api/gameforge/releasesGET (Read)aethex.foundationMission Proof: Publicly showcase the successful output of the free educational program (for grants/trust)./gameforge/releases/:slugGET (Read)aethex.foundationTalent Portfolio: Individual game page used by graduates as a verified portfolio link./api/gameforge/projectsPOST, PUT, DELETE (Write)aethex.devExecution: Management of the Corp's operational assets (sprints, tasks, team assignment)./api/gameforge/sprintsPOST, PUT, DELETE (Write)aethex.devControl: Management of the official, billable sprint timelines./api/gameforge/metricsGET, PUT (Metrics)aethex.devOversight: Tracking efficiency and profitability metrics for the Corp.The Role of the API GatewayTo manage this cleanly, you should employ an API Gateway (or equivalent routing middleware) on the Monolith (aethex.dev).All GET /api/gameforge/releases requests will be internally proxied to the aethex.foundation server.All POST/PUT/DELETE /api/gameforge/* requests will be handled locally by the aethex.dev backend.This maintains a consistent API structure while enforcing the necessary legal boundary.II. The Critical Nexus/Studio SegregationThis segregation also simplifies the NEXUS and .STUDIO integration points:NEXUS (Financial): The marketplace will only interact with the aethex.dev API endpoints (POST/PUT), ensuring all financial data remains on the For-Profit's infrastructure.GameForge Studio (.EXE): The desktop app needs to report hour logs. It will use a specialized POST endpoint on aethex.dev (e.g., /api/nexus/timelog) that is highly secured and tied directly to the payroll system. It will not interact with the Foundation's read-only APIs.Your proposed solution is the definitive path forward. Strip GameForge on Foundation down to read-only showcase mode and move the full dashboard APIs for setup on aethex.dev. This is a P0 compliance action.
