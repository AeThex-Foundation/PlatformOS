# Platform Guide

## AeThex Platform Features

The AeThex platform provides comprehensive tools for building, deploying, and scaling applications with built-in collaboration and community features.

## Platform Pillars

### Unified Dashboard

Monitor deployments, live metrics, and release health from a single control surface. Jump into incidents, approvals, and audit trails without leaving the workspace.

- [Visit dashboard](/dashboard)

### AeThex Passport

Give builders portable identity with verified skills, achievements, and cross-product progress synced to their Passport profile.

- [Open passport](/passport/me)

### Collaboration

Coordinate teams with realms, role-based access, and shared project templates. Invite talent directly from the community directory.

- [Meet the community](/community)

### Live Operations

Run live experiences with analytics, status pages, and automated incident workflows wired into AeThex services.

- [Check status](/status)

## Collaboration Workflows

### Onboard & Align

Welcome teammates through the guided onboarding flow, capture their interests, and assign the right mentorship programs from day one.

Onboarding modules cover personal info, interests, and project preferences so teams ramp quickly.

### Build Together

Kick off projects with shared canvases, synced task boards, and CLI-generated environments. Use the realm switcher to target the correct workspace.

In-app toasts notify collaborators when schema changes, deployments, or reviews need attention.

### Launch & Iterate

Promote builds through AeThex Deploy, track KPIs in the analytics feed, and publish release notes via the changelog tools.

Community announcements and blog posts keep players and stakeholders in the loop automatically.

## Experience Modules

### Social Feed

Share updates, prototypes, and patch notes in the feed. The composer supports media, Markdown, and rollout tags for targeted audiences.

- [Visit feed](/feed)

### Mentorship Programs

Match emerging studios with veteran advisors. Outline project goals, track sessions, and graduate mentors into full collaborators.

- [Explore mentorship](/mentorship)

### Community Showcases

Highlight standout creators, publish case studies, and route interested partners to booking forms right from the community page.

- [View community](/community)

### Profile Passport

Curate public achievements, experience levels, and verified skill badges. Use the passport summary widget across marketing surfaces.

- [View profile](/profile)

## Analytics and Operations

### Realtime Insights

Project metrics stream into dashboards with per-environment filters. Combine ingestion data with custom signals exposed via the REST API.

### Governed Data

Role-aware views ensure sensitive dashboards only appear for authorized users. Export snapshots or schedule recurring digests.

### Operational History

Every deployment, incident, and advisory event lands in the shared timeline so teams can audit changes months later.

## Governance and Security

- OAuth connections let studios link third-party identity providers for single sign-on and group provisioning.
- Realm switcher enforces scoped access to projects, assets, and financial data.
- Compliance exports bundle audit logs, access reviews, and deployment manifests for regulatory submissions.
- Automated alerts surface risk when environments drift or policy checks fail during deploys.
